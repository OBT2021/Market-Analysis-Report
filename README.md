# Market-Analysis-Report
🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between average household income, state-level sales, and product affordability across the United States. Using Power BI, the dataset was explored to determine:

How income distribution varies by state.

Whether higher income states generate higher sales.

The best product fit for customers based on their income brackets.

The findings provide data-driven insights into purchasing behavior, income disparities, and strategic product positioning for businesses.

📊 Key Insights & Findings
1️⃣ Income Distribution Across States
✅ Highest Average Household Income – District of Columbia, followed by New Jersey.
✅ Lowest Average Household Income – Mississippi.

2️⃣ Income vs. Sales by State
✅ The state with the highest sales does not always have the highest income.
✅ A strong correlation (0.78) was found between average sales per state and household income, suggesting that income influences sales but is not the only factor.
✅ Scatter plot visualization confirms the positive relationship between income and sales.

3️⃣ Best Product Fit Based on Income Brackets
✅ Products were categorized by affordability, aligning high-income earners with higher-priced items.
✅ Limitations: Real-world purchasing behavior is influenced by personal preferences and spending habits, not just income.
✅ Various Power BI Visualizations were used:

Donut Chart – Percentage breakdown of customer product fit.

Histogram – Income distribution summary.

Tree Map – Proportional representation of product affordability by income.
